/*
  The homepage hero's live sample chat. A visitor lands mid-argument with a
  partner who is very badly keeping a secret — short, funny,
  classroom-appropriate lines that show the roleplay format at a glance.
  Played by the same demo engine as the student chatbox demo (`useChatDemo`),
  so typing in the hero gets a reply.

  Both casts are people a teacher would actually assign: English casts
  Cleopatra against Brutus the night before the Ides of March, Hebrew casts
  גולדה against בן־גוריון in the hours before the Declaration. Same joke, same
  beat structure, no shared sentence — see DECISIONS.md → "The hero demo is
  cast from the lesson, and it shares the demo activity's world" and "The
  Hebrew demo is re-cast, never translated".

  Each language's hero plays inside the same setting as that language's demo
  activity (`activityDemo.ts`), so the homepage promises the world the demo
  then delivers. It is a different room, though, not a preview of the demo's
  own chat: different students, a different moment, no shared line.

  Two deliberate limits, in both languages (see DECISIONS.md → "The hero demo
  goes quiet after two Armstrong lines", which named the old cast but caps
  this one):
  - After the visitor's zinger, the partner sends exactly two one-sentence
    lines. The teacher preview mirrors this same feed and always shows its
    newest lines, so a longer script buries the zinger in both views.
  - `ambientLines` is empty on purpose — no idle chatter. Once the script
    ends, the room waits for the visitor to answer.

  Names: the demo's fiction is that the visitor is borrowing a student's seat.
  The teacher card names that student, never "You" — the teacher assigns
  chats and is not a player. Real names stay short to keep the card header
  tight. See DECISIONS.md → "Demo students have short names, and the teacher
  is never one of them".

  The homepage copy names these characters, and it reads them from
  `heroCopyNames` below rather than repeating them — so a recast can't leave
  the page describing a chat that isn't on it. Copy changes still go through
  the humanizer pass (see AGENTS.md).
