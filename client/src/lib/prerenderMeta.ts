  The build-time half of the page meta: one `PrerenderPage` per public URL, for
  `client/scripts/prerender-head.mjs` to stamp into a copy of the built shell.

  THIS MODULE'S WHOLE IMPORT GRAPH IS EVALUATED IN NODE, at build time, with no
  DOM of any kind. Nothing reachable from here may touch `document`, `window`,
  or `localStorage` at module scope, and nothing may reach `lib/api.ts`, which
  throws at module init in a production build without `VITE_API_URL`.

  It lives under `src/` on purpose, not in `scripts/`: `tsconfig.app.json`
  includes `src`, so `tsc -b` typechecks it with the `@/` alias and the i18next
  key augmentation for free. Nothing in the app imports it, so it never enters
  a bundle.

 * - **`og:url` is the locale's home** (`/he`), matching what `index.html`'s
 *   hand-written twin already claims for English. It is the one field a shared
 *   session link can't answer honestly; `robots.txt` disallows this file, and an
 *   unfurl card naming the product beats one naming nothing.
 * - **It DOES carry `og:locale`.** `index.html` omits the pair because that
