 * Teacher surfaces: activity setup and the live host dashboard. Registered
 * from `i18n/ns/teacher.ts`, so it rides those pages' chunks.
 *
 * The monitoring chat card's strings are deliberately NOT here — it renders on
 * the homepage too, so they live in `common`.
 *
 * Everything a teacher TYPED (the host name, character names, the student
 * instructions, an email address, a student's real name) arrives as an
 * interpolation and is never translated. Names and addresses come through
 * `{{x, bidi}}` so a Latin run inside a Hebrew sentence can't drag the
 * punctuation to the wrong end.
