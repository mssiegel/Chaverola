/**
 * The box the student's chatbox sits in, on both stages — the demo's
 * `ChatStage` and the live `LiveChatStage`. The two stages stay separate
 * components on purpose (never a conditional hook); this is only the frame
 * they agree on, so a sizing fix lands on both at once instead of on
 * whichever one someone remembered.
 *
 * Phones: fill the world edge-to-edge (~8px margins) so the composer sits on
 * the keyboard — `self-stretch` without a width is what lets `-mx-2` actually
 * widen the box. The min-h floor keeps the demo card from being crushed by
 * its sibling controls. From `sm` up: a fixed centered card.
