 * and a language pill (see DECISIONS.md → "While a student types on a phone,

          student types, handing its band to the chatbox.

          Every pad is an inset with today's spacing as its floor (the setup
          dock's idiom), because index.html's viewport-fit=cover runs the page
          under the notch. The left/right ones are the landscape half: rotate a
          notched iPhone and the notch eats the corner the language pill sits
          in. `pl`/`pr`, not `ps`/`pe` — the env() vars are PHYSICAL, and this
          app now really does mirror under /he, so a logical
          `ps-[…inset-left]` would put the left notch's inset on the right

          80px is bar-pad (16) + pill (~40) + gap (24), so once the bar's own
          pad grows to the notch inset this has to grow with it — hence
          `4rem + inset` (the 64px of bar-and-gap) under a 5rem floor, which is
          exactly today's pt-20 wherever the inset is 0. The collapsed pad
          takes an inset too: the corner bar hides while typing, the status bar
          does not, so a bare pt-2 would slide the chat card under it.

          The bottom pad is the one this whole change is for: it's what holds
          the composer's send button out of the home-indicator strip. The chat
          card's -mx-2 stretch is horizontal only, so it can't bypass this. */}
